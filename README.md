# MultiRespDL

A Deep Learning based Multitasking model for estimation of Respiratory Rate from ECG and accelerometer.

## Research

### Architecture
The architecture consist three blocks Encoder (F1), Decoder (F2), and IncResNet with Dense Layer (F3) as shown in figure below:

Different configuration using these blocks are designed as part of work. These configurations also differ in terms of inputs and outputs as given in the figure below:
